# Stock-Predictions-Model
This project was a fantastic opportunity to blend data science with web development and deploy a practical solution.

Steps to Predict Stock Price
- Data Source: We collected stock data using YFinance for the period between January 1, 2012, and December 21, 2022.
- Tools Required
  - TensorFlow: For building and training the LSTM neural network model.
  - YFinance: To fetch real-time and historical stock data.
  - Matplotlib: For visualizing stock price trends and model predictions.
  - NumPy & Pandas: For efficient data processing and manipulation.
  - Streamlit: To deploy the model as a user-friendly web application.
    
Key Features of the App:
- Displays stock data for any entered symbol.
- Shows visualizations of stock prices compared with moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200).
- Predicts future stock prices using an LSTM model and displays original vs. predicted prices.
